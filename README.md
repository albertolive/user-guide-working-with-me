A User Guide To Working With Albert Olivé

I’m delighted to be working with you! And I’m excited about all we’ll learn from each other! I already have high expectations that our collaboration together will yield some wonderful things :) That said, we are unique people shaped by our respective life experiences, and we likely have different preferences and styles for how we like to work. 

I’m writing this user guide to give you a better handle on me and my values, quirks, and growth areas so that we can develop the strongest relationship possible. I encourage you to do the same and share your user guide with me as well!

#### **How I view success**

*   A manager’s job is to continually aim for better and better outcomes for her team. If my team is not happy or not producing good work, then I am not doing a good job. A manager’s three major levers for better outcomes are **people** — hiring, coaching, and matching the right person with the right role; **purpose** — clarity on what success looks like; and **process** — clarity on how to best work. Of these three levers, I believe people are the most important. 
    
*   Success is constantly learning and getting better. We can’t always control the results, and if we aim high we will sometimes fail. But no matter the outcome, there are always lessons to be mined. Those learnings are ours to keep forever.
    
*   The path to success matters as much as the outcome. Everyone gets lucky and unlucky sometimes. But if we’re good, our success will be sustainable because it’s our process that works. 
    
*   It’s better to set ambitious goals that we don’t always meet than to sell ourselves short.
    
*   We can always do and be better. 
    
*   Success without integrity is like a car without an engine. 
    

#### **How I communicate**

*   I’m more likely to fade to the background in meetings, preferring instead to listen, observe, and process, versus jumping into the mix early and often and unwittingly control a discussion or shut others down.
    
*   Because a lot of my job is nurturing creativity, my preference is for others to come to the right solution with their own conviction, not to tell others what I think the right solution is. However, I recognize that sometimes the most pragmatic and efficient thing is to be clear with my opinion early on so we can resolve major misalignments. If I am not being clear and you worry we may not be seeing eye to eye, please let me know.
    
*   I am continually working on being more direct, especially about concerns or things I don’t think are going well. I commit to giving you frequent feedback or suggestions that I think may help you. If it doesn’t feel like I am being direct enough, or if my feedback is not helpful, please let me know.
    
*   I place a lot of value on having a clear big-picture narrative and being able to speak to the meaning behind the work, as well as what’s exciting about it. If you aren’t sure why we are working on something, please let me know.
    
*   I prefer email for asynchronous team communication. Please use email if you’re describing an issue with a good deal of context. I respond to most things within 2 workdays, so if I’ve been slow, re-ping me as I do sometimes miss things. If something easy to respond to, feel free to message me over Slack and allow me the rest of the day to respond, and if it’s really urgent you call me / whatsapp / Telegram at +34 670839647.
    
*   If you feel something is better discussed with me in person, don’t hesitate to drop a note with what you’d like to talk about. If you are a direct report, I will try my best to move things around so we can meet as soon as possible--it’s extremely important to me that you feel you always have time when you need it. If you are not a direct report but I can be of help to you, then we’ll schedule a time during the next available office hours block. Occasionally, I’ll lack the necessary context to be useful, and in those cases, I will decline the meeting and suggest another person who would be better able to assist you.  
    

#### **Things I do that may annoy you**

*   I’ve high levels of perfectionism and I’m working to overcome it as this is not a good skill. For that reason, I can seem sometimes demanding, critical, and never satisfied rather than supportive, encouraging, or empathetic. Since then, I've come to learn that different people respond better to different styles. Please know that I am always in your corner, and I care about you, even as I work on showing that better.
    
*   I am generally more focused on inputs than outputs. This means that if there is a positive outcome, but the process of getting there didn't seem sound or intentional to me, I might not see it as a cause for celebration. This can be frustrating if you are more focused on outputs than inputs.
    
*   I can fall into the bias of assuming everyone has the same context as I do, and as a result, not communicate the context or my perspective as clearly or as broadly as I should. Please remind me to provide more context if I do this.
    
*   Because I have a tendency to think long-term, I might give you impractical or complex suggestions when what you’re looking for is pragmatic, short-term options. Please remind me of the problem context if you feel my feedback is unhelpful or if you observe that I am trying to boil the ocean.
    
*   I'm optimistic and see the best in others, and sometimes that may strike you as naive or unrealistic when I'm convinced a tough situation can be fixed with greater effort versus a structural change.
    
*   In conversations or discussions, I naturally prefer to process input I've taken in versus taking action and speaking. I like pondering all the options before making a decision. If you’re not getting an answer right away (and you need it) or if any of my points are not absolutely clear, please ask me to clarify or to be precise with action items.
    
*   I can be reluctant to change. I take comfort in routines because, for me, the familiar is far less stimulating than something brand new. For this reason, change — both positive and negative — can really throw off me and I’ll need more time than others to adjust to change.
    
*   Overwork is chronic these days, especially in the U.S., and that results in rushed deadlines and stress for everyone. I may become easily overwhelmed, particularly when under pressure. I do my best work slowly and deliberately when I have plenty of time to think things through.
    
*   Because of the nature of my job, I spend a large chunk of my days interacting with others. For that reason, I don’t usually enjoy spending lunch breaks catching up with colleagues or having small talks. And that’s why, at lunchtime, I like to go swimming on the beach to recharge the batteries.
    

#### **What gains and loses my trust**

*   The easiest way to win my trust is to care about getting high-quality outcomes and to be transparent about what you think is going well or not well. I admire people with keen self-awareness, who are constantly looking to learn, and who admit their challenges and growth areas. I also admire people who go out of their way to ask others for feedback—whether about a piece of code developing work, a project proposal, or their own behavior—and use it to improve. Conversely, if I hear about a big problem involving you from someone else, I will assume either a) you are oblivious to the issue, or b) you didn’t want me to know, both of which will erode my trust. I am suspicious of those trying to sell me a narrative that everything is perfect, or that there is nothing they could have done any better.
    
*   Another thing that builds my trust is extreme ownership of a problem. I am impressed when someone goes out of her way not just to identify a problem, but to rally the right people and processes in solving it. I love it when people use all the resources at their disposal—including me!—to overcome challenges in their path. Conversely, my trust is lost with those who frequently act like victims and who complain about problems and expect them to be solved by others. 
    
*   I appreciate people who make commitments and stick to them. I expect you to come to recognize and improve on this over time, and to reset expectations as soon as you realize a commitment cannot be fulfilled. I lose trust in people who repeatedly fail to honor their commitments to do X by Y. 
    
*   I build trust easily with those who dream big, who skew toward optimism, and who manage to translate that optimism into actionable plans.
    
*   If you give me critical feedback about a colleague and you have not yet delivered the message to that person directly, I will suggest you do that first. I am happy to help you work through the best way to share feedback, but I have little tolerance for office politics and espousing a culture where people complain about their colleagues behind their backs. If I observe you frequently saying things that you'd be embarrassed to have someone else overhear (or be printed in the press), it will erode my trust in you. I have a low tolerance for drama, unprofessional behavior, or disrespect among senior members of the team.
    
*   If I give you repeated feedback about your work or your behavior and nothing changes as a result, it will diminish my trust in you. I will do my best to debug why this is happening, as perhaps my feedback was unclear, or my expectations are unrealistic, but please help me to understand this as well. 
    
*   It’s easier for me to build trust with you if you treat me like a human and a peer, versus someone you are trying to impress. I will trust you more if you give me good feedback, or if you thoughtfully challenge what I say.
    

**How do I coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?**

*   First of all, I like understanding and mentoring people by providing tools and guidance on improving their skills. People need to feel understood, otherwise they won’t listen.
    
*   We are all a work in progress (myself included), never believe you’ve done enough and don’t be afraid to fail. Prove yourself ![(smile)](images/icons/emoticons/smile.png)
    
*   It is always in the company’s interest to give you as much responsibility as you can manage. Don’t wait around to be asked to take on responsibility.
    
*   **Leaders** are **made not born**. Management is a vocation, but leadership is a responsibility anyone and everyone can and should take on. You can lead by seeing a problem and solving it, architecting a solution for others, coming up with a new idea and selling it internally, finding someone who can help achieve our goals and recruiting them. We are all constantly surrounded by opportunities to lead.
    
*   If you want to progress your career fast (1) Take responsibility to manage your own career as nobody else will do it for you, (2) work very hard to put yourself in the right place at the right moment in time, and (3) seek the help of those who have done it before.
    

#### **My strengths**

*   **Awareness**: I notice subtleties and distractions in my surroundings. This makes me be aware of what works and what doesn't, both for myself and for others.
    
*   **Insightfulness**: I’m aware of the potential "people problems" before they become serious, and I have the insight to know how to deal with them.
    
*   **Empathy**: I’m often intuitive and empathic, and I understand people and their motives deeply. This means that I can interpret and resolve interpersonal problems effectively. I also dislike conflict and I care about others' feelings and needs, which allows me to create harmonious working environments.
    
*   **Supportive**: I love sharing my knowledge, experience, time, and energy with anyone who needs it, and all the more so with friends and family. I always strive for win-win situations, choosing empathy over judgment whenever possible.
    
*   **Conscientiousness**: I’m hardworking, meticulous, and careful and vigilant about quality, taking a steady approach, and bending with the needs of the situation just enough to accomplish my end goals. I’m able to see the details and the big picture, and I can visualize different possibilities.
    
*   **Long-term focus**: I think long-term when it comes to prioritizing people, processes, and strategy. I generally have a clear vision of where I'd like things to be in the future and lots of ideas on how we might get there.
    
*   **Thoughtful intentionality**: I seek to understand a problem and its context before venturing a solution or opinion. This means that I typically have a well-framed rationale for why I think what I think, or a framework in mind when working through a problem.
    
*   **Strong relationships**: I get along well with most everyone and have built up strong credibility and trust with many leaders across the company. I am excited to meet new people and learn from them. If I can help you have more impact through my relationships, please let me know.
    

#### **My growth areas**

*   **Tough feedback**: When a coworker oversteps a boundary or makes a mistake, the prospect of letting them know about it can cause me stress because of my empathetic nature. That's why I have a hard time giving feedback or having difficult conversations.
    
*   **Directness and simplicity in communication**: I am working on cutting through the noise, and closing the gap between what I want to express and what others hear. I'd like to get better at quickly diving into the heart of complex issues and turning them into principled frameworks.
    
*   **Meta-prioritization**: Though I have reliable tools for prioritizing well when it comes to specific projects, I am still struggling to figure out better prioritization systems at a higher level--how to best juggle relationships (old and new), doing specific work, learning, thinking, and meeting.
    
*   **Overcome Perfectionism**: I tend to be conscientious, detail-oriented, and organized. While these traits can give me an edge in many situations, when they get out of control, it can make me anxious, stressed, and exhausted.
    
*   **Reluctant to Change**: We work in a fast and agile environment. These can be particularly hard to address since I value traditions and history highly in my decisions. A situation sometimes needs to reach a breaking point before I’m persuaded by circumstance.
    
*   **Take things too personally**: I can have trouble separating personal and impersonal situations – any situation is still an interaction between two people, after all – and any negativity from conflict or criticism can carry over from professional to personal lives, and back again. For example, I tend to have strong emotional reactions to criticism. As I always try to put the needs of others first and generally want to make people happy, when I’ve been told I did something wrong (even in the most professional context), it can be like an arrow to my heart.
    
*   **Storytelling**: I tend to remember lessons, not stories. But stories are one of the most effective ways of imparting lessons. I’m working on becoming a better storyteller in my communication.
    
*   **Expanding domains of knowledge**: there’s so much I want to better understand. I feel like a novice in many, many areas, including investing, healthcare, education, social justice reform, economics, finance -- the list goes on and on.
